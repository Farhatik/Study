Question 1
Select correct statements about overfitting:

Answer:
Large model weights can indicate that model is overfitted

Overfitting is a situation where a model gives lower quality for new data compared to quality on a training sample

2.
Question 2
What disadvantages do model validation on holdout sample have?

Answer:
It can give biased quality estimates for small samples
It is sensitive to the particular split of the sample into training and test parts

3.
Question 3
Suppose you are using k-fold cross-validation to assess model quality. How many times should you train the model during this procedure?

Answer: k

4.
Question 4
Select correct statements about regularization:

Answer:

Regularization restricts model complexity (namely the scale of the coefficients) to reduce overfitting

Weight penalty drives model parameters closer to zero and prevents the model from being too sensitive to small changes in features
